Title: Introduction

This library implements several helpers for working with file paths.

It implements two different approaches:

 * a functional interface implementing Wrappers for <DLL-calls to Windows API: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/shlwapi-path> and other helper functions
 * a class interface <Path> which offers an object-oriented interface to the functional interface
